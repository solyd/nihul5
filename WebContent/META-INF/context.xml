	<!-- maxActive: Maximum number of database connections in pool. Make sure 
		you configure your mysqld max_connections large enough to handle all of your 
		db connections. Set to -1 for no limit. -->

	<!-- maxIdle: Maximum number of idle database connections to retain in pool. 
		Set to -1 for no limit. See also the DBCP documentation on this and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis 
		configuration parameter. -->

	<!-- maxWait: Maximum time to wait for a database connection to become available 
		in ms, in this example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if this timeout

	<!-- removeAbandoned: When available database connections run low DBCP will recover and recycle 
		any abandoned database connections it finds. The default is false. -->

	<!-- removeAbandonedTimeout: Use the removeAbandonedTimeout attribute to 
		set the number of seconds a database connection has been idle before it is 
		considered abandoned. default is 300 secs. -->

	<!-- logAbandoned: The logAbandoned attribute can be set to true if you 
		want DBCP to log a stack trace of the code which abandoned the database connection 
		resources. -->

	<!-- username and password: MySQL username and password for database connections -->
